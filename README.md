# Hi there, I'm Abdulrahman Sirelkhatim!🖐

## *Medical Student | Aspiring Data Scientist | Global Health Advocate*

## About Me! 👦

I'm a 4th-year medical student passionate about data science and programming.
I love the way I can use programming languages such as Python and SQL to create
fascinating analyses and visualizations, as well as process huge datasets in a
matter of seconds. I also appreciate how these languages have driven the
development and advancement of various industries,including healthcare,
engineering, and computer science. I dream of becoming a data scientist after I
graduate from medical school. I love Audi, and my dream car is an Audi RS7
Performance. I also aspire to own a Koenigsegg Agera one day 😅.
My favorite anime is **No Game No Life**, and my favorite character is
**Kiyotaka Ayanokoji** from *Classroom of the Elite*.

## What I'm Working on Now 🎯

- Building my first website project, inspired by a model design to enhance my
organization’s online presence.
- Drafting a research proposal on trauma surgeons' preparedness for mass
casualty incidents.
- Exploring ways to integrate medicine and technology, from telemedicine
platforms to health informatics.

## Experience 💼

I have completed several data science projects after earning my IBM Data Science
 Professional Certificate, including:

- **Australia Wildfire Analysis**: Data-driven insights into wildfire patterns
and their impacts.
