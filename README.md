# Hi there, I'm Abdulrahman Sirelkhatim!🖐

#### *Medical Student | Aspiring Data Scientist | Global Health Advocate | Supporter of Digital Transformation of Health*

## About Me!👦
I'm a 4th year medical student passionate about data science and programming. I love the way I can use programming languages such as Python and SQL to create all these fascinating analyses and visualizations as well as going through huge datasets in a matter of seconds. 
I also love how these languages helped in the development and advancement of all industries whether the healthcare sector, engineering sector and even the computer sciences discipline as well. I dream to one day become a data scientist after I graduate from medical school. 
I love Audi and my dream car is an Audi RS7 Performance. I also dream of having a Koenigsegg Agera one day😅. My favoirite anime is **No Game No life** and my favorite character is **Kiyotaka Ayanokoji** from Classroom of the Elite.

## What I'm working on now 🎯

- 🌐 Building my first website project, inspired by a model design to enhance my organization’s online presence.
- 📝 Drafting a research proposal on trauma surgeons preparedness for mass casualty incidents.
- 💻 Exploring ways to integrate medicine and technology, from telemedicine platforms to health informatics.
